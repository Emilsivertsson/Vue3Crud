# Todo app

### Description
First project in Vue.js as part of a school assignment. The app is a simple todo app that allows the user to add, delete, edit and mark tasks as completed. \
The webapp is meant to be a frontend for a Springboot backend thatÂ´s hosted on AWS.

### What was your motivation?
The assignment was to create a Ci/Cd pipeline for the backend , from my local machine, to github action and then to AWS.\
To make the pipeline more interesting I decided to create a frontend for the backend.

### Installation
To install the project, you need to have npm and node installed. \
Then you can clone the project and run the following command in the terminal to install the dependencies.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
The app will be running on localhost:8081

### Usage
On the left side of the app you can add a new task by typing in the input fields and clicking the submit button. \
On the right side you can see all the tasks that you have added.\
You can delete a task by clicking the delete button, edit a task by clicking the edit button and toggle the status of a task by clicking the complete/incomplete button.

Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an assets/images folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```
